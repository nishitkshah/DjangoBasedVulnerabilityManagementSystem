# DjangoBasedVulnerabilityManagementSystem
This project was created to explore Django Web Framework and Mongo DB. It also involved creation of APIs using Django Rest Framework.
This Django based Vulnerability Management System is desgined with scalability in mind.
Findings can be distributed across multiple app nodes so as to prevent bottle neck of an individual app node.
The app nodes are managed by a manager node.
